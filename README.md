# Your Secret Tracker

#### MileStone 1 --- Week 1 
Get familiar with Realm.io and retrieve the GPS data from the Pictures/

#### MileStone 2 --- Week 2
Retrieve the Location Data from the GPS info in the background, included Zipcode and State and City

#### MileStone 3 --- Week 3 (Going On:))
Thinking of what kind of feature you want to employ:

Implemented a SeekBar TimeLine that could allow the user to search the photo by moving across the bar, but doesn't 
include search for a specific month.

#####Next Step:
By Location: Group it together according to location, which involves the cluster technique: How to show large amount of data on map

- The unseen part should not be generated
- The cluster with more places should be a bigger icon with the corresponding number
- Which Algorithms to choose, anything to do with the index of the database(layer)


#####The IMPROVEMENT: 
Imagine there are many user's photo library, how to recoginize that maybe you guys are at the same time when
you don't even know each other. What's more, implement the the ML face recogintion in your photos (?)will there be security problem involved. And how to redesign the database to demonstrate the users. 
Tap on the Map, shows the nearest place you've been to 
#### The Presentation --- Last Week
What is your Algorithms, How to demo your App, Any other Chart or data to show the Comparison?
